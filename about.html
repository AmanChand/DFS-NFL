  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'n not a scammer, not a fantasy shark, just someone who knows his sports, especially Football. 
     I've been playing Fantasy Football for years, last year was the first year I played on Fanduel and Draftkings
     and it was a major success for me. I'll be sharing my lineups for Fanduel and Draftkings on this site, 
     along with results of my lineups, and analysis of player stats and matchups. My lineups are not 100% guaranteed to 
     win all the time, the game is hard to predict but I'll do my best to help. Good luck everyone!

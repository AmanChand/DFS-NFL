  <h1>Who To Target</h1>
  <p><b>Week 1</b></p>
  <p><b>QB</b></p>
  <p><b>Aaron Rodgers(FD-$9700, DK-TBA)-</b> at Chicago Bears, last season Rodgers threw for 617 yards, 10 TDs and 0 Ints
  against the Bears in 2 games, with the Packers winning both games by a combined score of 93-31 the Bears defense didn't do much this offseason to get any better, 
  expect a field day by Rodgers, spreading the ball around to his WR's, putting up lots of points in a Packers blowout win. Rodgers is my top play at QB, he is perfect
  for both Cash and GPP games.
  Rodgers 2014 Stats- 4,381 passing yards, 38 TDs, 5 Ints </p>
 
  <p><b>Cam Newton(FD-$8400, DK-TBA)-</b> 2014 Stats- 3,127 passing yards, 18 TDs, 12 Ints.
  Last season Cam didn't have exactly a great 2014 stat wise. He has a good matchup against the Jaguars who ranked 26th in total defense last season.
  I see him starting off the season strong, one thing that does concern me are his turnovers but should be limited since they're facing the Jaguars.
  GPP option would be the best for Cam, shouldn't be too high owned, but if you are taking him, at the same time I would suggest taking Benjamin and Olsen also. </p> 

  <p><b>Phillip Rivers(FD-$8100, DK-TBA)-</b> It seems like no matter who Rivers has at WR he continues to put up big time passing numbers after throwing for 4,286 passing yards
  and 31 TDs. This season he won't have Eddie Royal, won't have Gates for the first 4 weeks, but don't worry, he'll be fine. Chargers will at home against the Lions who no longer
  have Suh. Lions had the 2nd best total defense in the NFL last season but gave up 231 pass yards per game, plus with no Suh now, their sack numbers could take a dip. Rivers is a 
  good GPP play if you want to stack up more on RB and WR and want a QB who isn't too expensive. </p>
 
  <p><b>Marcus Mariota(FD-$7100, DK-TBA)-</b> This is a completely biased and cheap pick here, I'm a huge Oregon Ducks fan and really high on Marcus. Its his first NFL game, against
  the Buccaneers who ranked 25th in total defense and gave up 255 passing yards per game. He's very cheap, will be low owned, but who knows how Titans will run their offense with him,
  the best guess is plently of read options, and play action passes. Most people feel Marcus isn't ready for the NFL but he proved many wrong in College after being a 3 star prospect.
  GPP option. </p>
  
  <p><b>RB</b></p>

  <p><b>Eddie Lacy(FD-$8500, DK-TBA)-</b> 2014 Stats- 1,139 rushing yards, 9 TDs. He's a solid option at RB against the Bears, even though he didn't put up the big numbers against the Bears
  last season mainly because of Rodgers doing all the work, with the game most likely being a blowout, Lacy will see a lot of carries. Cash game play. </p>

  <p><b>C.J. Anderson(FD-$8400, DK-TBA)-</b> CJ will be hands down the starter at RB and with Manning declining, CJ will see a lot of carries. Last season was a great coming out party for Anderson,
  had back to back 165+ yard games, had multiple 3 TD games and finished off the season with 849 yards and 8 TDs and he was only the starter for half the season. In week 1 he faces off a Ravens defense
  that does really well against the run giving up only 88 rush yards per game last season, but goal line carries make Anderson very valuable. He's a cash and GPP option. </p>
  
  <p><b>Carlos Hyde(FD-$7300, DK-TBA)-</b> New RB in SF, younger, and when he got carries last season he did really well. Vikings defense last season gave up 121 rush yards a game, so this matchup could 
  be great for Hyde and a really good price and the upside is high. Cash and GPP option. 
 
  <p><b>Joesph Randle(FD-$6900, DK-TBA)/Darren McFadden(FD-$6600, DK-TBA)-</b> This all depends on who's starting, I truely believe the Cowboys made the right decision in handling their RB situation, 
  both RBs have value right away with the Cowboys Offensive Line which is very consisent and will open up big holes. GPP option for both, but we'll still have to see who's the starter. </p>


  <p><b>WR</b></p>

  <p><b>Jordy Nelson(FD-$8600, DK-TBA)-</b> 2014 Stats- 98 Receptions, 1,519 Yards, 13 TDs. Nelson is the top target in a great WR core for the Packers and Rodgers loves to spread the ball around to all 
  his WRs. Last season Nelson torched the Bears in 2 games catching 16 passes, 260 yards, and 4 TDs, in 2 games! Expect similar results by Nelson in a blowout game, but he will most
  likely do all his damage in the first half. A must play in Cash and GPP, especially if you're going with Rodgers at QB. </p>

  <p><b>A.J Green(FD-$8300, DK-TBA)-</b> Green had a solid 116 catches, 1,041 yard season last season but the 6 TDs is quite low for a WR of his caliber. Week 1 against the Raiders could be a field day 
  for Green against a bad Raiders defense and the price for Green is solid. A GPP play option for me, don't expect a blowout here because the Raiders will compete in this game so Green will be involved in
  the pass game even late into this game. The last two seasons in week 1 Green has put up great numbers also. </p>

  <p><b>T.Y Hilton(FD-$7800, DK-TBA)-</b> Very surprised his price is quite low, even with Andre Johnson there, Hilton is the true #1 WR in Indy and has a great relationship with Luck. With Johnson on the other
  side of him now, Hilton won't be seeing much double coverage and continue to see a lot of targets. Last season he saw 130 targets and had 82 catches with 1,345 yards. The TD numbers weren't all that great at 7.
  Buffalo has a good defense but worth the risk taking Hilton because Luck will find ways to get him the ball. GPP option. </p>

  <p><b>Kelvin Benjamin(FD-$7500, DK-TBA)-</b> Benjamin had a very impressive rookie season going over 1,000 yards and catching 9 TDs and saw 146 targets. He's the best WR on the Panthers and will continue to see
  a lot of targets and will only get better. Playing against the Jaguars this is a great matchup for Benjamin and I see him starting off the season with a big game. Cash option and GPP option if you're taking Cam at QB </p>

  <p><b>Jordan Matthews(FD-$6800, DK-TBA)-</b> The new #1 WR in Philly in a confusing yet lots of potenital new offense. It doesn't matter who's at QB for the Eagles, Matthews is a must play because he is going up against
  the worst defense from a year ago. He'll see a lot more targets than he did last season and this could be the beginning of something big for Philly. In Chip Kelly's offense, theres gonna be screen passes, slants, deep routes, 
  and Matthews being there last season and having a good rookie year has a lot to build off. 2014 Stats- 67 catches, 872 yards, 8 TDs. Cash and GPP option. </p>

  <p><b>Malcom Floyd(FD-$5900, DK-TBA)-</b> Cheap option at WR for both Cash and GPP, last season he had a good season with 856 yards and 6 TDs. Will get the majority of the targets in the opening week
  with Gates suspended. As mentioned earlier it doesnt matter who his WRs are, Rivers will throw the ball a lot. Keenan Allen is the Chargers top option but Floyd isn't too far behind and with Allen taking some of the attention,
  could see a lot of openings for Floyd. </p>

  <p><b>Davante Adams(FD-$5500, DK-TBA)-</b> Rodgers loves spreading the ball around and it seems like there's always a WR for the Packers who has a breakout season. Adams finished off last season strong especially in the playoff game
  against the Cowboys. Against the Bears, Adams is a good cheap play especially for GPP. </p>

  <p><b>Terrance Williams(FD-$5300, DK-TBA)-</b> I love Terrance Williams, a big deep ball threat and had a good season last season. Cowboys will look to pass a lot more and Williams could see more targets than he did last season. 
  Williams had only 37 catches last season, but 8 were TDs. Romo will look to him when Dez is being double covered and in the Red Zone. Good play against the Giants defense which gives up a lot of yards. GPP option. </p>

  <p><b>TE</b></p>

  <p><b>Greg Olsen(FD-$5900, DK-TBA)-</b> 2014 Stats- 84 catches, 1,008 yards, 6 TDs. Olsen was one of my favorite TEs to use last season and he gets a lot of targets. Against the Jaguars in week 1 and I see him having a good start to
  the season. Will continue to see his usual amount of targets, see him getting in the end zone also. Cash and GPP option. </p>

  <p><b>Ladarius Green(FD-$5700, DK-TBA)-</b> With Antonio Gates suspended, Green finally gets his chance to start for the Chargers. Rivers will be looking his way quite a bit and a cheap price for week 1 makes Green a solid GPP option. </p>

  <p><b>Owen Daniels(FD-$5500, DK-TBA)-</b> A new TE with Peyton Manning makes him a very attractive option at TE. He's also played under Gary Kubiak before. Very cheap price and great option at GPP, with Thomas and Sanders getting a lot of defensive
  focus, could open up room for Daniels in the pass game and he's always been a good catching TE. Last season Daniels had 527 yards and 4 TDs. </p>

  <p><b>Vernon Davis(FD-$5300, DK-TBA)-</b> Davis was playing through injury last season, with a new head coach, new offensive approach could see a lot more targets for Davis in the pass game and him returning to his old self. Week 1 is good week to target
  Davis, its monday night, home game, 49ers want to prove their doubters wrong, Kaepernick will be looking to Davis's way. Bold prediction, Davis matches his 2014 TD total (2) in week 1. Cash and GPP Option. </p>

  <p><b>DST</b></p>

  <p><b>Carolina Panthers(FD-$4800)-</b> Rough for Blake Bortles last season and it's going to be a rough start for him seeing the Panthers defense in week 1. Panthers had 40 sacks as a team last season and 14 ints. Top option at defense for me. Cash and GPP. </p>

  <p><b>Green Bay Packers(FD-$4500)-</b> High risk, high reward here, Jay Cutler lost his best WR in Brandon Marshall, Packers were about middle of the pack in NFL in giving up yards, but forced turnovers, they had 18 ints as a team, and also 41 sacks. Cutler is
  way turnover prone and Packers defense could have a great day. Cash and GPP option </p>

  <p><b>New York Jets(FD-$4400)-</b> Up against the Cleveland Browns, one of the big messes at offense in the NFL, expect to see a lot of turnovers being forced by the Jets defense, especially with Revis back now. There is no one on the Browns offense that scares me.
  Cash and GPP option.</p>

  <p><b>Kansas City Chiefs(FD-$4300)-</b> Texans have a lot of question marks on offense, Chiefs defense is pretty low priced and they could rack up quite a big amount of sacks and force a couple of fumbles, but be aware, they gave up 127 rushing yards a game last season
  so Foster could see some openings. </p>

  <p><b>New York Giants(FD-$4100)-</b> Before you think I'm crazy here, do you guys remember that game in 2012 Tony Romo threw 4 ints against the Giants? In Texas Stadium? This pick is mainly on that. I feel Romo is gonna try to do way too much and will force passes in coverage
  and Giants will get their share of Ints. Last season in week 1 Romo threw 3 ints. Romo always tends to throw ints against the Giants, especially at home. GPP pick here because at the same time, Cowboys will rack up a lot of yards. But a few ints here and there can make the Giants
  Defense quite valuable. </p>

  <p><b>K</b></p>

  <p><b>Mason Crosby(FD-$5100)-</b> I like targetting really cheap kickers but Crosby is the top play at kicker considering how many points Packers will put up in this game. Also should get some Field Goal chances too. Cash and GPP option. </p>

  <p><b>Nick Folk(FD-$4600)-</b> Jets offense is still quite of a question mark with Geno at QB so I don't see them going touchdown crazy against a good Browns defense that will hold them at times, which will allow Folk to get on the field for Field Goals. Cash and GPP option. </p>

  <p><b>Graham Gano(FD-$4600)-</b> He's cheap, as mentioned before Panthers offense should score against the Jaguars. Gano will get his extra points and a couple field goals. Cash and GPP. </p>

  <p><b>Possible Stacks to Consider</b></p>

  <p>Note: Fanduel Stacks you can't have any more than 4 players from one team</p>

  <p><b>Green Bay Packers-</b> Aaron Rodgers-Eddie Lacy-Jordy Nelson/Davante Adams/Mason Crosby </p>

  <p><b>Carolina Panthers-</b> Cam Newton-Kelvin Benjamin-Greg Olsen-Graham Gano/Jonathan Stewart </p>

  <p><b>San Diego Chargers-</b> Phillip Rivers-Keenan Allen-Malcom Floyd-Ladrius Green </p>

  <p><b>Indianapolis Colts-</b> Andrew Luck-T.Y Hilton-Andre Johnson-Frank Gore/Coby Fleener/Hakeem Nicks/Adam Vinatieri (high risk against a good Buffalo defense but these players should be low owned in GPP) </p>
